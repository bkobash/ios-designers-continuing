#Exercise 2: Custom transitions

![Alt text](https://github.com/bkobash/ios-designers-continuing/raw/master/wk2-custom-transitions/wk2-wip.gif)

<!--
### Tasks
* Create a scrolling page that has one or more images with parallax effects
* Blur the image as the user scrolls down the page
* Parallax an image in the middle of the page
* Have the image at the top of the scroll view expand as you pull down

### Still to do
* When the user yanks down on the scrollview, improve the photo placement on top. The user should be able to see the topmost portion of the photo before we start to scale up the image. 
* Create a single way to set up parallax effects for all images. Maybe you should be able to pass in a UIImageView, its container UIView, and a float to indicate how much "depth" you want - and this sets all the frame sizes accordingly. Then,  scrollViewDidScroll() would somehow iterate through all those elements that were affected.
