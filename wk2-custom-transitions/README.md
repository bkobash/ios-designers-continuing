#Exercise 2: Custom transitions

![Alt text](https://github.com/bkobash/ios-designers-continuing/raw/master/wk2-custom-transitions/wk2.gif)

### Tasks
* When the user taps on an event, show a detail view with a smooth "image expand" transition
* When the user dismisses an event, the detail view's image shrinks back down into the original position in the calendar

### Optionals (Finished)
* Animate the month header up when the image collides with it
* Slide out the + button when the detail view gets presented
* Pop in the pencil button when the detail view gets presented
* Add a drop shadow to the month header
* Add a parallax effect to the city image
* Implement the challenge with UITableView instead of UIScrollView
* Make the "24 Thu", "25 Fri" section headers scroll out with the last event of that day

### Still to do
* Some tweaks to the section headers
* Figure out how to animate the + button back in when the detail view gets dismissed
