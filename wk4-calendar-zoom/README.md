#Exercise 4: Calendar zoom

![Alt text](https://github.com/bkobash/ios-designers-continuing/raw/master/wk4-calendar-zoom/wk4.gif)

### Tasks
* When the user taps on an month in the year view, zoom in to show the month view using a custom push animation
* When the user taps Back, zoom back out using a custom pop animation
* Translated the original project into a storyboard/segue project

### Still to do
* Learn how anchor points work, and apply transforms relative to those anchor points. All this was done with origins and a ton of hack work. So, I suspect that it won't work as well on non-iPhone 6 viewports.
